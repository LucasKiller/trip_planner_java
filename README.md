# trip_planner_java ✈🧳

Trip Planner Java is an application developed in Java aimed at helping users plan their trips efficiently and organized. The system allows users to create, manage, and track travel itineraries, including details such as destinations, dates and activities.

## Project information 👨‍💻

The workspace contains these folders by default, where:

- `database`: the folder to maintain a already preset database
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

Upon starting the program, it opens the initial screen, which consists of a user login and password or a registration form. If registered, the information will be sent directly to the database. Upon logging in, the user will be redirected to the control panel screen where they can create a new trip or edit an existing one. Additionally, the user can edit and view their own profile.
